# linkml-sandbox
Experimental repository for exploring a common framework for bioimaging metadata models

As discussed during the [2023-03-15 NGFF community call](https://forum.image.sc/t/community-call-metadata-in-ome-ngff/77570),
interested community members will start collecting [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) representations of bioimaging models in this
repository. This will allow an evaluation of the framework and the investigation of possible commonalities that could be shared
between the models.
